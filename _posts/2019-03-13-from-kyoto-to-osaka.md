Japan is an amazing country. It is steeped in culture, tradition, and yummy foods. Aside from purely being a tourist, I've been most focused on observing their interpersonal customs. Japanese, from what I've gleaned, are extremely kind, welcoming, and well-mannered in all their dealings. It is inspiring. It has led me to reexamine my own temperament and mood â€” something I hope to continue once I return from vacation. I've also taken an interest in trying to learn some Katakana... here's to being hopeful. Kampai!
