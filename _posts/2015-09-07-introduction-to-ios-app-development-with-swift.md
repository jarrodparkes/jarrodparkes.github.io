On Mondays through Fridays, I create learning materials for Udacity's iOS Nanodegree, but I never actually found time to take the Nanodegree myself. On this 3-day weekend, I changed that. I am currently finishing the first course/project, and I am really enjoying learning from my fellow Udacians and peers. Here is my post for what I've learned so far in the [Introduction to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585-nd) course.

### TAKE TIME TO READ

Multiple times throughout the course, the teacher (Kunal) suggests that students go and read documentation, Stack Overflow posts, or other student's comments to understand a problem. This has been enlightening for me as a student and a teacher, and I plan on trying to include more great reading resources in my future courses.

### BREAK PROBLEMS DOWN

When you are teaching a foreign concept, especially one that is programming-related, it is great to give clearly defined steps to help scope and set expectations for students. I really love Kunal's step-base approach to building the first app, Pitch Perfect, and how he introduces concepts just as you need them (a.k.a "just-in-time learning").

### YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING NEW

I have gone through my fair share of "introductory iOS courses", but I always gain a new understanding. This time, I learned the shortcut for fitting/scaling a UI component to fit its contents—specifically UILabels. I'm looking forward to using it soon!
