I’ve been keeping pace with learning Japanese since returning from mainland Japan. Luckily, I stumbled upon a local language school that teaches Japanese (as well as Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and French). My second class is today, and I’m anxiously awaiting another brain overload — even if I don’t understand everything during the class, I’ll absorb details that manifest later.

My other current project is finishing my basement workshop/laboratory. When complete, it will be the secret hideout from where I’ll plan future development and learning projects. I’ve always wanted to have a setup similar to Dexter from the children’s television show, Dexter’s Lab.
