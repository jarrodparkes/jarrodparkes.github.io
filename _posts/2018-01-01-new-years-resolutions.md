2018 starts today, and in two days I start my new job as mobile lead for CommentSold â€” a local software company that has an e-commerce platform for selling products on social networks like Facebook and Instagram. This has been a big transition for me, from full-time teacher to developer, but I'm excited for the challenge, and I'm eagar to share my learnings with others. Aside from the job, I have a few new year's resolutions that I'd like to capture here for my own record:

- launch 10+ apps on the App Store
- launch first Android App on the Google Play Store
- build a framework in Kotlin
- finish my game room for entertaining friends and family
- relaunch the N64 Game Index app with full text search
- build and launch a web api using Node
- expand the N64 Game Index to support more platforms
- film live shows for the Collecting Dust podcast
- start Twitch stream for Collecting Dust podcast
- book 10+ wedding customers for La Rue French Macarons
- build an app for La Rue to handle mobile orders and integrate with Square
- help my dad with his genealogical research by adding 3 generations-worth of records from my in-laws family
- revive the Huntsville Swift Users Group
- publish a book on microservice development in Swift
- build and launch a dominoes iOS app
- add 5 new websites to the ParkesTwins portfolio

I'm going to print these out and put them on the refrigerator!
