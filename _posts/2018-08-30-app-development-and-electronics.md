It's been four months since I've written on this blog. Since that time, I've gone from managing one handful of mobile apps to nearly two hundred. My day-to-day development involves improving a core library called CSKit that exists both for iOS (in Swift) and Android (in Java). It's exhilarating work, and I've been lucky enough to balance that work with purchasing my first home and settling comfortably into a productive weekly routine — weekdays are the job, weekends are church, family, and personal projects.

I started a new online course on electronics taught by the well known André LaMothe. So far, the course is great, and I'm chomping at the bit to begin constructing a home lab and my first circuits. I hope that by the time I'm done finishing the class, I'll have enough electronics knowledge to repair my once-working Atari 2600. Perhaps I'll muster the confidence to start completing my own console mods :)!
