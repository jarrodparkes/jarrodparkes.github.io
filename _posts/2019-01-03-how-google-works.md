_"How Google Works" by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenburg_

My Notes

- things a company should have
    - you need a mission, mission ideas for CS
        - products that make things "easy to sell, easy to buy"
        - e-commerce, made easy
        - buyer-centric vs. seller-centric vs. both?
        - meetings buyers and sellers were they are
        - increasing seller reach
    - you need a workspace conducive for smart creatives
        - open work spaces
        - but it should also have places to retreat
        - also some that are nice and quiet for focused work
    - you need values
        - listing comment sold cultural values
            - no opinion is better than another because of tenure
            - the best ideas win
            - nothing is sacred
                - the project you worked on all weekend may not be the one we need to use
                - the project that made us 1st million might not be the one that will help us 10x
- finding direction, making decisions
    - all product decisions should be based on a technical insights, not unfounded opinions
    - open platforms grow faster, consider them for certain problems and areas ‚Äî especially when challenging big incumbent companies
    - don‚Äôt obsess over competitors
        - know who they are and be ‚Äúproud‚Äù of them, but don‚Äôt copy them ‚Äî you‚Äôll just me incrementally growing and not truly innovate
- hiring
    - should be peer based
    - set standards really high, find people‚Äôs passion in the interview, hire learners (growth mindsets and grit!)
    - you want smart generalists not specialists!
    - ask yourself, would you want to be stuck in an airport with this person for 6 hours? Hire interesting people! But not necessarily people you like
    - you don‚Äôt have to hire someone with Java experience for a Java job, hire the best engineer you can and if they know Java that‚Äôs just a bonus
    - hire someone who you know has high potential career trajectory
    - during interviews ask questions that will show off candidate's thinking, not their resume
        - ‚ÄúHow did you pay for college?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I was to look at your browser history what would I learn that isn‚Äôt on your resume?‚Äù
    - don‚Äôt hire people that give generic answers
    - good interviews should last about 30 minutes
    - final hiring decisions should be left to committee
    - don‚Äôt hire people who prefer to work alone
    - don‚Äôt hire people who just want a job
- teams/careers
    - to keep smart creatives, keep their jobs interesting by all means possible
        - ex: have them shadow CEO for 6 months
        - ex: set them on useful tasks (even if it is outside their comfort zone), don‚Äôt let them settle
    - team building
        - ‚ÄúMake managers trade away their MnMs, let them keep the raisins‚Äù
    - people leaving a company usually isn‚Äôt b/c compensation, so listen carefully to what they are frustrated with
    - career growth is like surfing
        - you want to surf in the right industry/spot and try to catch the best wave/company and ride it as long as you can
    - everyone should get good at statistics/data b/c it is going to be just as big as coding in the next decade
    - everyone should think like a CEO and read!
    - imagine you run into your CEO in the hallway and they ask what your working on. What do you say? Is it a solid pitch?
- meetings
    - all meeting rooms at google has two TVs, one for teleconference and one for data
        - have a bias for data in making decisions
        - also a bias for action when data/debate no longer yields any new learning
    - meeting regularly for decisions that are fundamental to the company can be a good thing
    - data and a speech don‚Äôt convince people, but data a speech and appealing to emotions do ‚Äî ‚Äúthe Oprah rule‚Äù
    - all meetings should have an organizer & decision maker
        - organize/decision maker sends the invites, has the agenda 24hrs in advance, and sends summary/decisions made email afterward
    - all meetings can be cancelled at any time for not having organizer or agenda
- 80/20 rule: spend 80% of your time on 80% of your revenue
- data
    - company should default to open; share as much information as efficiently as possible to everyone
        - all OKRs, even personal ones, should be shared
        - only things that have legal ramifications shouldn't be shared
    - presentations should have less slides and focus on quality charts/data
- company communication
    - leadership needs to "know the details", don't be hands-off
        - Eric S. keeps a list of questions for people on Apple Notes so he can bring them up when he sees those people
    - having a system like Canny for internal company questions to ask upper management can be a good way to help those who have trouble asking questions in big open scenarios (as long as all questions are asked in good will, this can become toxic too)
    - real conversation trumps chat
    - write down your own user manual for yourself (interesting idea üí°)
    - company ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù ‚Äî a place where everyone writes down weekly short notes about what got done, short reflection, etc (like a big public diary for the company)
    - over communicate the important big ideas or values and do it honestly, with varied media, and to the people you want to hear it
        - don‚Äôt just ‚Äúsend all‚Äù, not give a reason you think it is relevant, and not direct the conversation to something productive
    - "trip reports" are an effective meeting tool to get everyone talking "where did you go, what did you learn"
    - if you are a manager, ask yourself: Would you work for you?
    - answer emails quickly, keep your inbox clean, don't waste time, don't YELL, be concise
    - continually be looking ahead, what can we be doing better, should we be looking at other products/solutions, are we the best in our field?
    - business partnership comm. should be based on diplomacy, it is better when we work together even if our ideologies might differ
    - when speaking with the press have insights not canned responses
    - communication idea: don‚Äôt work on anything for a week and just talk to people across the company to learn about problems and processes
- innovation
    - Innovation - radically new things; but also when 500 incremental changes combine to make something great
    - innovative culture should support the crazy person trying something new and the first adopters who add fuel to the fire
    - focus on the user, and the revenue will follow (user-first)
    - 10x
        - **you aren‚Äôt thinking big enough, w/e you‚Äôre thinking about 10x it!**
        - doing 10% better requires tweaks, doing 10x better requires rethink
        - ask how you could 10x a metric, it will require radical change!
    - all green OKRs are bad, you didn‚Äôt set your targets high enough
    - 70/20/10 resource allocation core/successful-ideas/crazy-ideas
    - constraints force creativity, a lack of resources forces ingenuity
        - don‚Äôt over-budget innovation, you can MVP something for real cheap!
    - 20% time
        - 20% time is for individuals time, not to be confused with 70/20/10 resource allocation
        - 20% time really isn‚Äôt about time, it‚Äôs about freedom, it‚Äôs freedom to work on something even though you weren‚Äôt asked to ‚Äî it‚Äôs just because you‚Äôre motivated about it
        - You don‚Äôt get compensation bonuses for 20% projects, compensation will dilute innovation
    - ‚ÄúDemo days‚Äù are a way that google encourages people to build prototypes; most won‚Äôt go on to be a product, but everyone will learn something, collaboration, and be able to bring that back to their work
    - Ship and Iterate quickly and use data to feed the winners and starve the losers
    - Don‚Äôt ship crappy products tho, ship MVPs that are quality and could get to the wow moment within a few iterations
- the future...
    - how will you go to smart creatives or get them to come to you?
    - What are your competitive advantages? What would you do if you lost them? Would your customers stay?
    - How will emerging technology effect your business?
