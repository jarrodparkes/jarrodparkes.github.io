I'll write this post quickly because things are busy! I'm in the middle of moving into a new home, launching dozens of apps with CommentSold, and completing the "game room of all game rooms" that will become the headquarters of the Collecting Dust podcast. From a development standpoint, the most exciting thing I've been working on is the infrastructure that powers the CommentSold mobile platform. I can't tell too much, but suffice to say that we are heavily utilizing automation tools and scripting to quickly create apps for our customers. In the future, I may do a quick tutorial on one of my favorite new tools, [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer), which we are utilizing as part of our stack.
