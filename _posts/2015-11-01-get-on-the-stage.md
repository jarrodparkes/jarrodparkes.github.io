Nothing has gone right today.

My red eye flight back to Huntsville was delayed by two hours, and now I'm stuck in the Dallas airport with too much free time and nowhere to sleep.

As a consolation, the rest of this week has been wonderful. I attended the Swift Summit in San Francisco, met some influential developers, and spoke with two of my students face-to-face!

I took a few notes at the conference: code, experiments, and future talks. The goal is to get on that stage.
