Learning and teaching game physics, has been my focus the past month. At first, I was very apprehensive to take on a completely new topic -- I never took physics in high school or college -- but, I believe that my inexperience has better prepared me to teach newcomers. The fruit of my month-long labor is a sandbox of physics demos built with Box2D and libGDX. Be on the lookout for the sandbox soon!
