Prime8 Kart Racing is a racing game inspired by other kart-racing classics like Mario Kart 64 and Crash Team Racing for Sony's Playstation. In the summer of 2010, I started working on this game by developing the kart mechanics. Since I knew the mechanics of Mario Kart 64 were widely adopted and fun to play, I collected test data from an N64 emulator and the Luigi Raceway level. This is what later inspired to recreate Luigi Raceway in Unity3D so that I could use the level to test my code.

The second phase of the project involved a lot of play testing, some small feature development, and the gathering of good concept art. As seen in the slider, our friend Casy Kovach provided us with some awesome conceptual drawings for the monkey characters. His portfolio can be seen here.

I never finished Prime8 Kart Racing because of other work and school engagements. Final touches to the project included adding a position tracker, a lap display, and a GUI interface designed by my twin brother James.
