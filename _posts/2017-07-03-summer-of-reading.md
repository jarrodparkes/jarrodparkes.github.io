Last week, I vacationed at [Seacrest Beach](http://www.visitsouthwalton.com/beaches/seacrest) near Panama City, Florida. This trip, an annual pilgrimage for my family and friends, gave me the much needed time to refresh and motivate myself. I purchased two new books — ["The Vanishing American Adult"](https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-American-Adult-Coming-Crisis/dp/1250114403) and ["Do I Make Myself Clear?"](https://www.amazon.com/Do-Make-Myself-Clear-Writing/dp/0316277177) — to wrestle with my own feelings of self-doubt and to also (hopefully) improve my reading and writing abilities. The first book, written by Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, explores the tragedy of an emerging culture of "childlike adults". Ben asserts that many millennials are falling victim to living lives of crippling technological dependency, social acceptance, and consumerism that is so rampant that it has stolen their ability to properly "come of age" and become true adults. The second book, written by Harold Evans, provides expert guidance on how to write effectively. I've finished the first book, and I'm making steady progress on the second. I hope to continue this trend of reading and writing more regularly, but we'll see how well my plan performs. We'll see if I possess the necessary diligence and self-control to continue this pace...
