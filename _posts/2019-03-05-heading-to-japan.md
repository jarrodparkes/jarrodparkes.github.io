Tomorrow I'll be heading to Japan. I can't wait! This will be the first time I've traveled to the eastern hemisphere, and aside from a cruise to Mexico, it will be my first time out of the country. Katie started a family and travel blog to chronicle the adventure at [The Parkes Blog](https://www.theparkesblog.com).

We'll be staying in Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo, and some of the highlights of the trip will include...

- ryokan
- capsule hotel
- animal cafes
- so much sushi
- fish market
- temples
- Fuji-san!
- yoga
- matcha green tea
- Tokyo Giants
- cherry blossoms
- Akihabara, Tokyo (otaku district)
- arcades
- ...and so much more!
