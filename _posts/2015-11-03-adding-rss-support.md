It's really early in the morning and I can't sleep. So, why not add support for RSS feeds and auto-posting to social networks?

Thankfully, this appears to be an easy addition according to Eduardo Bou√ßas. In his post [Sharing Jekyll posts on social media using front matter and IFTTT](https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2015/04/28/sharing-jekyll-posts-on-social-media-using-front-matter-and-ifttt.html), he describes a clever way to use the template system provided by Jekyll to create XML feeds.

Crossing my fingers that this will work. This will be my first new feed item to Facebook and Twitter.
