I'm still finishing the electronics class I mentioned in my previous post. This course has inspired me to acquire a working Commodore 64, and now I'm embarking on an adventure to build a game for the platform. The C64 uses the same machine language (6502) as the NES which I've programmed for so I'll be in familiar territory. My initial plan is to make a "game" that maps the electrical switches in my house to my main switch board. _When the electrical box was replaced in our house, the electrician didn't mark all the electrical switches with meaningful labels_. I hope to document the development here and on my [newly created Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/parkesfjarrod/).
