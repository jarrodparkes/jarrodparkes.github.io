I'll keep it short and sweet. I've been working on a collection of games in libGDX: a cat simulation, a mini-golf game, and a simple physics game. It is taking all my time, and it is quite stressful. However, I won't give up on them or posting one blog post per month.

In other news, I'm getting married in less than 2 months. I'm looing forward to saying "I do" and to the honeymoon. I need a break!
