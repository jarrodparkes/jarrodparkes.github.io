_"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days" by Jake Knapp_

My Notes

- a design sprint is a clear step-by-step process which addresses a challenge with a high-fidelity tested solution in less than a week
- design sprints are purposely structured to avoid "loudest voice wins" and "open brainstorming"; instead it uses individual exercises that produce artifacts which are reviewed and voted upon so that the strongest ideas win
- super high-level steps in sprint:
    - Day 1: define challenge, explore solutions
    - Day 2: make a decision on best solution, create storyboard
    - Day 3: select key screens, create prototype, internal test of prototype
    - Day 4: user testing, summary analysis
- roles in sprint:
    - decider: this person makes the final decisions which move the team through the sprint
    - moderator: moves the sprint team along from step-to-step
    - experts/participants: each team member participating in the sprint; ideally cross-company, diverse team with different perspectives
- the prototype which is tested should be like goldilocks --> not too little (like a paper prototype), not too much (a fully engineered, backend-supported solution), but just right (for many applications a high-fidelity keynote presentation works wonders! it almost feels like the real thing with a fraction of the time to develop)
- the prototype will take a tester through an entire journey of discovering your solution and using it to solve a problem (ex 1: starts at app store, finishes with first purchased product; ex 2: starts with an ad attached to the customer's last purchase — like something in the shipping box — encouraging them to download the app and use a coupon code, finishes with first purchased product and the additional savings :)!!)
- when interviewing testers ask "why" and open-ended questions
